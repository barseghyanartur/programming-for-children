Programming for children
========================
A quick presentation of some of the features of Arduino (lights, sound module,
button) and Microbit (lights, accelerometer). It's a workshop material for
children of 6-7 years old.

Material has been originally written in Dutch, but may be translated into
other languages.

Some of the code samples are taken from Internet.

If not stated otherwise, written by me (see the `Author`_).
